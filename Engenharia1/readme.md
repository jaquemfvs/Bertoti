# Frase

We see three critical differences between programming and software engineering: time, scale, and the trade-offs at play. On a software engineering project, engineers need to be more concerned with the passage of time and the eventual need for change. In a software engineering organization, we need to be more concerned about scale and efficiency, both for the software we produce as well as for the organization that is producing it. Finally, as software engineers, we are asked to make more complex decisions with higher-stakes outcomes, often based on imprecise estimates of time and growth.

# Comentário

Programção é você saber programar, talvez um ou mais tipos de linguagem. Já Engenharia de Software, alem de saber programar, precisa-se saber qual a melhor linguagem para se utilizar, entender a funcionalidade do que está sendo pedido pelo cliente, escolhendo o que será melhor para um projeto.
